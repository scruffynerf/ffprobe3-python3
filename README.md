ffprobe3-python3 module
=======================

A Python3 wrapper-library around the `ffprobe` command-line program to extract
metadata from media files or streams.

(**Note:** This wrapper-library depends on the `ffprobe` command-line program
to extract metadata from media files or streams.  The `ffprobe` program must
be installed, with an `ffprobe` executable that can be found by searching the
`$PATH` environment variable.)

This package began as a fork (and is now a complete rewrite) of package
``ffprobe-python`` which was maintained by Mark Ma:

- https://pypi.org/project/ffprobe-python/
- https://github.com/gbstack/ffprobe-python

Changes and improvements in this fork
-------------------------------------

Noteworthy improvements in this fork include:

- Fixed a few Python3 compatibility bugs in the pre-fork code.
- Re-wrote the `ffprobe` call to request & parse the `json` print-format.
- Handle "Chapter" in ffprobe output.  ("Stream" was already handled.)
- Support/allow remote media streams (as `ffprobe` program already does).
- Local-file-exists checks are optional (use `verify_local_mediafile=False`).
- More classes, with more attributes & methods for commonly-accessed metadata.
- Provide datasize as bytes (`1185288357`) & human-readable (`"1.2 GB"`).
- Provide duration as seconds (`5751.787`) & human-readable (`"01:35:51.79"`).
- All ffprobe-output classes wrap & retain their JSON data for introspection.
- All ffprobe-output classes can be reconstructed from their JSON `repr()`.
- Added several derived exception classes for more-informative error reporting.
- Re-wrote the subprocess code to use convenient new Python3 library features.
- Documented the API (Sphinx/reST docstrings for modules, classes, methods).

These are the currently-implemented classes to wrap ffprobe JSON output:

- `FFprobe(ParsedJson)`
- `FFformat(ParsedJson)`
- `FFchapter(ParsedJson)`
- `FFstream(ParsedJson)`
- `FFattachmentStream(FFstream)`
- `FFaudioStream(FFstream)`
- `FFsubtitleStream(FFstream)`
- `FFvideoStream(FFstream)`

Significant API-breaking changes in this fork include:

- **Changed the client-facing API of functions & classes**.
- **No longer support Python 2 or Python3 < 3.3**.

I renamed this forked repo to `ffprobe3-python3`, because:

- The client-facing API of functions & classes has changed; and
- The supported Python version has changed from Python2 to **Python3 >= 3.3**.

Example usage
-------------

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import ffprobe3

# Function `ffprobe3.probe(media_filename)` is the entry point to this module;
# it's the first function you want to call.

# Local media file:
ffprobe_output = ffprobe3.probe('media-file.mov')

# ... or, a remote video stream:
ffprobe_output = ffprobe3.probe('http://some-streaming-url.com:8080/stream')

# Examine the metadata in `ffprobe_output` (of class `FFprobe`):

# The "format" key in the parsed JSON becomes an `FFformat` instance:
media_format = ffprobe_output.format

# The size of the media in Bytes (if provided by `ffprobe`):
if media_format.size_B is not None:
    print("media size = %d Bytes" % media_format.size_B)
# ... or in human-readable base-10 prefix format (e.g., "567.8 MB"):
if media_format.size_human is not None:
    print("media size = %s" % media_format.size_human)

# The duration of the media:
if media_format.duration_secs is not None:
    print("media duration = %f secs" % media_format.duration_secs)
# ... or in human-readable "HH:MM:SS.ss" format (e.g., "01:04:14.80")
if media_format.duration_human is not None:
    print("media duration = %s (HH:MM:SS.ss)" % media_format.duration_human)

# Access a list of streams using `.streams`:
print("media contains %d" streams" % len(ffprobe_output.streams))

# Access a list of chapters using `.chapters`:
print("media contains %d" chapters" % len(ffprobe_output.chapters))

# Access specific stream types directly by named attribute of `FFprobe`:
# In this new code version, each stream attribute of class `FFprobe` also
# contains a list of instances of *only* a single specific derived class
# of base class `FFstream`:
# - `.attachment` -> `FFattachmentStream`
# - `.audio` -> `FFaudioStream`
# - `.subtitle` -> `FFsubtitleStream`
# - `.video` -> `FFvideoStream`
video_stream = ffprobe_output.video[0]  # assuming at least 1 video stream
audio_stream = ffprobe_output.audio[0]  # assuming at least 1 audio stream

# Derived class `FFvideoStream` has attributes `width` & `height` for
# the frame dimensions in pixels (or `None` if not found in the JSON):
video_width = video_stream.width
video_height = video_stream.height
if video_width is not None and video_height is not None:
    print("video frame shape = (%d, %d)" % (video_width, video_height))

# Class `FFvideoStream` also has a method `.get_frame_shape()`,
# which returns the frame (width, height) in pixels as a pair of ints
# (or `None` if *either* dimension's value is not found in the JSON):
video_frame_shape = video_stream.get_frame_shape()
if video_frame_shape is not None:
    print("video frame shape = (%d, %d)" % video_frame_shape)

# This `get_frame_shape()` is a method with a name that begins with `get_`
# (rather than simply an attribute called `frame_shape`, for example) to
# indicate that:
#     (a) It has a "default" `default` of `None`
#         (like Python's `dict.get(key, default=None)`).
# and:
#     (b) You may override this "default" `default` as a keyword argument
#         (for example, if you would rather return a pair `(None, None)`
#         than a single `None` value, for 2-tuple deconstruction).
#
# So you could instead use a 2-tuple deconstruction with a default `None`
# for each element:
(video_width, video_height) = video_stream.get_frame_shape((None, None))
if video_width is not None and video_height is not None:
    print("video frame shape = (%d, %d)" % (video_width, video_height))

# Derived class `FFaudioStream` has an attribute `.sample_rate_Hz`
# (which defaults to `None` if no value was provided by `ffprobe`):
if audio_stream.sample_rate_Hz is not None:
    print("audio sample rate = %d Hz" % audio_stream.sample_rate_Hz)

# Not sure which attributes & methods are available for each class?
# Every class has 3 introspection methods:
# - method `.get_attr_names()`
# - method `.get_getter_names()`
# - method `.keys()`

# Which attributes does this class offer?  Get a list of names:
print(audio_stream.get_attr_names())

# Which getter methods does this class offer?  Get a list of names:
print(audio_stream.get_getter_names())

# Which keys are in the original dictionary of parsed JSON for this class?
print(audio_stream.keys())
```

**To see a comprehensive usage** of (almost all) the attributes, methods, and
exceptions in the `ffprobe3` class & function API, also look at test module
[`tests/test_ffprobe3.py`](https://github.com/jboy/ffprobe3-python3/blob/master/tests/test_ffprobe3.py) (link into GitHub repo).

Why does this fork exist?
-------------------------

I was attempting to use Mark Ma's
[`ffprobe-python` package](https://pypi.org/project/ffprobe-python/) with Python3,
but I was blocked by a parsing error in the library:

```python
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'groups'
```

This problem had already been reported
as [issue 2](https://github.com/gbstack/ffprobe-python/issues/2)
(almost 3 years ago) &
[issue 16](https://github.com/gbstack/ffprobe-python/issues/16)
(more than 18 months ago).  The most recent Github commit in
the [`ffprobe-python` repo](https://github.com/gbstack/ffprobe-python)
is dated 2021-05-13 (more than 18 months ago).
It looks like the `ffprobe-python` repo is no longer actively maintained?

This new repo now fixes the following bugs & implements the following
feature requests that are
["Open" issues](https://github.com/gbstack/ffprobe-python/issues)
on the `ffprobe-python` repo.

- **bug fix**
  ([issue 2](https://github.com/gbstack/ffprobe-python/issues/2),
  [issue 16](https://github.com/gbstack/ffprobe-python/issues/16)):
  Handle "Chapters" in media files (which are already supported by
  the command-line `ffprobe` program) instead of crashing.
  (Avoid error: `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'groups'`)
- **bug fix**
  ([issue 4](https://github.com/gbstack/ffprobe-python/issues/4)):
  Handle non-HTTP remote streams (which are already supported by
  the command-line `ffprobe` program) instead of raising an error.
- **bug fix** (I assume, but I have no "problem" media file for testing)
  ([issue 14](https://github.com/gbstack/ffprobe-python/issues/14),
  [issue 19](https://github.com/gbstack/ffprobe-python/issues/19)):
  Handle "Side data" and multi-line fields in media files (which I *assume*
  will be handled correctly by the `json` print-format, if the command-line
  `ffprobe` program already prints the `SIDE_DATA` tags) instead of crashing.
- **feature request**
  ([issue 4](https://github.com/gbstack/ffprobe-python/issues/4),
  [issue 16](https://github.com/gbstack/ffprobe-python/issues/16)):
  Simplify the stream-parsing code by replacing the custom code with the `json`
  print-format that is already offered by the command-line `ffprobe` program.

Which versions of Python are supported?
---------------------------------------

The **minimum supported Python version** is **Python3 >= 3.3**.

Python 3.3 was released on 2012-09-29 (more than 10 years ago now!).
Setting Python 3.3 as the minimum allows us to use the following
convenient Python3 language & library features:

- `__qualname__` attribute for the qualified name of classes
   ([PEP 3155](https://peps.python.org/pep-3155/))
- `yield from`
  [syntax for generator delegation](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.3.html#pep-380)
  ([PEP 380](https://peps.python.org/pep-0380/))
- `raise NewException() from None`
  [syntax for suppressing exception context](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.3.html#pep-409-suppressing-exception-context)
  ([PEP 409](https://peps.python.org/pep-0409/))
- exception base class [`subprocess.SubprocessError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#exceptions)
- [`subprocess.DEVNULL`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.DEVNULL)
- the `timeout` argument to functions
  [`subprocess.check_call`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.check_call),
  [`subprocess.Popen.communicate`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.Popen.communicate), and
  [`subprocess.Popen.wait`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.Popen.wait)
- [function `shlex.quote`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shlex.html#shlex.quote),
  if we ever need to shell-quote strings
- [function `shutil.which`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html#shutil.which),
  if we ever want to guess what `Popen` will use
- [the `asyncio` module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html)
  ([initially a package on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/asyncio/),
  before it was officially incorporated into the Python3 stdlib in Python 3.4),
  if we ever want to switch from `subprocess` to
  [`asyncio.subprocess`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-subprocess.html)
