"""
A Python3 wrapper-library around the ``ffprobe`` command-line program.

(**Note:** This wrapper-library depends on the ``ffprobe`` command-line program
to extract metadata from media files or streams.  The ``ffprobe`` program must
be installed, with an ``ffprobe`` executable that can be found by searching the
``$PATH`` environment variable.)

Example usage::

    #!/usr/bin/env python3

    import ffprobe3

    # Function `ffprobe3.probe(path_to_media)` is the entry point to this module;
    # it's the first function you want to call.

    # Local media file:
    ffprobe_output = ffprobe3.probe('media-file.mov')

    # ... or, a remote video stream:
    ffprobe_output = ffprobe3.probe('http://some-streaming-url.com:8080/stream')

    # Examine the metadata in `ffprobe_output`:

    # The "format" key in the parsed JSON becomes an `FFformat` instance:
    media_format = ffprobe_output.format

    # The size of the media in Bytes (if provided by `ffprobe`):
    if media_format.size_B is not None:
        print("media size = %d Bytes" % media_format.size_B)
    # ... or in human-readable base-10 prefix format (e.g., "567.8 MB"):
    if media_format.size_human is not None:
        print("media size = %s" % media_format.size_human)

    # The duration of the media:
    if media_format.duration_secs is not None:
        print("media duration = %f secs" % media_format.duration_secs)
    # ... or in human-readable "HH:MM:SS.ss" format (e.g., "01:04:14.80")
    if media_format.duration_human is not None:
        print("media duration = %s (HH:MM:SS.ss)" % media_format.duration_human)

    # Access specific stream types directly by named attribute:
    # In this new code version, each attribute contains a list of instances
    # of only a *single specific derived class* of base class `FFstream`:
    # - `.attachment` -> `FFattachmentStream`
    # - `.audio` -> `FFaudioStream`
    # - `.subtitle` -> `FFsubtitleStream`
    # - `.video` -> `FFvideoStream`
    video_stream = ffprobe_output.video[0]  # assuming at least 1 video stream
    audio_stream = ffprobe_output.audio[0]  # assuming at least 1 audio stream

    # Derived class `FFvideoStream` has attributes `width` & `height` for
    # the frame dimensions in pixels (or `None` if not found in the JSON):
    (video_width, video_height) = (video_stream.width, video_stream.height)
    if video_width is not None and video_height is not None:
        print("Video frame shape = (%d, %d)" % (video_width, video_height))

    # Class `FFvideoStream` also has a method `.get_frame_shape()`,
    # which returns the frame (width, height) in pixels as a pair of ints
    # (or `None` if *either* is not found in the JSON):
    video_frame_shape = video_stream.get_frame_shape()
    if video_frame_shape is not None:
        print("Video frame shape = (%d, %d)" % video_frame_shape)

    # Derived class `FFaudioStream` has an attribute `.sample_rate_Hz`
    # (which defaults to `None` if no value was provided by `ffprobe`):
    if audio_stream.sample_rate_Hz is not None:
        print("Audio sample rate = %d Hz" % audio_stream.sample_rate_Hz)

    # Not sure which attributes & methods are available for each class?
    # Every class has 3 introspection methods:
    # - method `.get_attr_names()`
    # - method `.get_getter_names()`
    # - method `.keys()`

    # Which attributes does this class offer?  It returns a list of names:
    print(audio_stream.get_attr_names())

    # Which getter methods does this class offer?  It returns a list of names:
    print(audio_stream.get_getter_names())

    # Which keys are in the original dictionary of parsed JSON for this class?
    print(audio_stream.keys())

This package is a fork (actually now a complete rewrite) of package
``ffprobe-python`` which is/was maintained by Mark Ma:

- https://pypi.org/project/ffprobe-python/
- https://github.com/gbstack/ffprobe-python

Significant changes in this fork include:

- Fixed a few Python3 compatibility bugs in the pre-fork code.
- Re-wrote the ``ffprobe`` call to request & parse the ``json`` print-format.
- Re-wrote all client-facing parsed-ffprobe-output classes to wrap parsed JSON.
- Re-wrote the subprocess code to use convenient new Python3 library features.
- **No longer support Python 2 or Python3 < 3.3**.
- **Changed the client-facing API of functions & classes**.
- Support/allow remote media streams (as ``ffprobe`` program already does).
- Local-file-exists checks are optional (use ``verify_local_mediafile=False``).
- Handle "Chapters" in media.
- All parsed-ffprobe-output JSON-wrapper classes have introspection methods.
- Added several derived exception classes for more-informative error reporting.
- Documented the API (Sphinx/reST docstrings for modules, classes, methods).

Read the updated ``README.md`` file for a longer list of changes & reasons.

class ParsedJson(Mapping):
    """
    Class `ParsedJson` contains a dictionary of parsed JSON.

    This class is a lightweight wrapper around the dictionaries of parsed JSON.
    We use this `Mapping`-interface container class as an alternative to either:

    - inheriting from built-in class ``dict``; or
    - mixing arbitrary JSON keys (produced by an external program)
      into a per-instance ``__dict__``.

    Instead, an instance of this class will reference (and share) the original
    ``dict`` instance of parsed JSON that was supplied to its constructor.
    It will **not copy** the argument ``dict`` items into a new ``dict`` owned
    exclusively by this instance.  As a result, for a given ``ffprobe`` output,
    all instances of derived classes of `ParsedJson` will **share the same
    original tree** of ``dict`` instances that was returned by ``json.loads``;
    they will each reference a different subtree of the shared tree.

    This class provides some convenient accessor methods for parsed JSON keys:

    - Python `abstract Mapping <https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.abc.html#collections-abstract-base-classes>`_
      interface (for Pythonic ``dict``-lookup):
      :func:`__contains__`, :func:`__getitem__`, :func:`__iter__`, :func:`__len__`,
      :func:`get`, :func:`keys`
    - lookup with type-conversion: :func:`get_as_float`, :func:`get_as_int`, etc.

    For convenient introspection of class `ParsedJson` (or any derived class),
    a list of accessor methods for that class is returned by
    :func:`get_getter_names`.  Example usage::

        >>> import ffprobe3
        >>> p = ffprobe3.probe("movie.mp4")
        >>> v = p.video[0]
        >>> v
        FFvideoStream(parsed_json={ ... valid JSON ... })
        >>> v.get_getter_names()
        ['get', 'get_as_float', 'get_as_int', 'get_datasize_as_human',
        'get_duration_as_human', 'get_frame_shape']

    For convenience, each of the multiple classes that derive from this class
    will define data attributes and/or additional accessor methods appropriate
    to that type.  For convenient introspection, a list of data attributes is
    returned by :func:`get_attr_names`.  Example usage::

        >>> import ffprobe3
        >>> p = ffprobe3.probe("movie.mp4")
        >>> v = p.video[0]
        >>> v
        FFvideoStream(parsed_json={ ... valid JSON ... })
        >>> v.get_attr_names()
        ['avg_frame_rate', 'bit_rate_bps', 'bit_rate_kbps', 'codec_long_name',
        'codec_name', 'codec_type', 'duration_secs', 'height', 'index',
        'parsed_json', 'width']

    In general, client code should not need to construct this class manually.
    Derived classes of this class are constructed by function :func:`probe`.
    But client code *will* want to invoke the methods of returned instances
    of those derived classes.

    derived classes that correspond to specific kinds of stream (as indicated

    derived classes:

    - :class:`FFsubtitleStream`: ``(codec_type == "subtitle")``
    - :class:`FFvideoStream`: ``(codec_type == "video")``

    If no ``codec_type`` is specified, or the specified ``codec_type`` is not
    recognized, then a plain old `FFstream` will be returned.

    The following data attributes provide convenient access to frequently-used
    keys & values expected in the metadata for an individual stream:

    :ivar index: index in the list of streams

    :ivar codec_name: short name of the specific codec used
